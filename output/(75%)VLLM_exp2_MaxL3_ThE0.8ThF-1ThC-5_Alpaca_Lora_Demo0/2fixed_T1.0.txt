Question: What general name is given to a rotating star which emits a regular beat of radiation?

Candidate: Rotator
Justification:
The general name given to a rotating star that emits a regular beat of radiation is a "pulsar." The answer "Rotator" is False for the question: "What general name is given to a rotating star which emits a regular beat of radiation?" because a "rotator" does not accurately describe the characteristics of a pulsar.

Question: how much is a 72 oz steak at the big texan?

Candidate: $50
Justification:
The answer "$50" is False for the question: "how much is a 72 oz steak at the big texan?" because the price of a 72-ounce steak at The Big Texan Steak Ranch varies depending on the steak's cut and the day of the week. The price typically ranges from $7 to $20. Since "$50" is not within this range, it is False.

Candidate: $120
Justification:
The answer "$120" is False for the question: "how much is a 72 oz steak at the big texan?" because the cost of the challenge is $72.00, not $120. The Big Texan Steak Ranch offers a free 72-ounce steak dinner to anyone who can eat the entire meal in less than an hour, but the cost of the challenge is $72.00, not $120. Additionally, the price of a 72-ounce steak at The Big Texan Steak Ranch varies depending on the steak's cut and the

Candidate: Thymus
Justification:
The answer "Thymus" is False for the question: "where are antibodies made and by what type of lymphocyte?" because the thymus is not the location where antibodies are made. Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are proteins produced by the immune system to help the body fight off infections and diseases. They are made by a type of white blood cell called B-lymphocytes, also known as B-cells.

B-cells are a type of lymphocyte, which are a type of immune cell. Lymphocytes are a part of the adaptive immune system, which is responsible

Candidate: lymph
Justification:
Lymph is False for the question: "where are antibodies made and by what type of lymphocyte?" because antibodies are made in the bloodstream and by B-lymphocytes, not in lymph. Lymph is a bodily fluid that helps transport immune cells and waste products, but it is not the location where antibodies are produced. On the other hand, B-lymphocytes are the type of lymphocyte that produce antibodies, so the answer "B-lymphocytes" is correct.

Question: In which country is the Sky Train Rail bridge?

Candidate: United States
Justification:
The SkyTrain Rail Bridge is located in Canada, not the United States. Therefore, the answer "United States" is False for the question "In which country is the Sky Train Rail bridge?" 

In contrast, the knowledge states that the SkyTrain system is operated by the TransLink regional transportation authority and is a popular mode of public transportation in the Vancouver area. This information confirms that the SkyTrain Rail Bridge is situated in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, which is in Canada. Hence, the answer "United States" is incorrect, and the correct answer is "Canada."

Justification:
The SkyTrain Rail Bridge is located in Canada, not China. Therefore, the answer "China" is False for the question "In which country is the Sky Train Rail bridge?" based on the given knowledge.

Candidate: Hanafi
Justification:
The answer "Hanafi" is True for the question "What is an orthodox Mahommedan sect whose name derives from a body of traditional teaching which has equal authority with the Koran?" because Hanafi is an orthodox Mahommedan sect that derives its name from a body of traditional teaching (Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence) that has equal authority with the Koran (the Quran). Hanafi is one of the four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and it is considered an orthodox branch of Islam, meaning it adheres to the teachings and beliefs of the Islamic faith.

Candidate: Maliki
Justification:
The answer "Maliki" is False for the question "What is an orthodox Mahommedan sect whose name derives from a body of traditional teaching which has equal authority with the Koran?" because Maliki is not an orthodox Mahommedan sect.

Question: What is the official language of Barbados?

Candidate: Portuguese
Justification:
The official language of Barbados is English, and Portuguese is not mentioned as an official language in the knowledge provided. Therefore, the answer "Portuguese" is False for the question "What is the official language of Barbados?" 

In this case, the knowledge states that "The official language of Barbados is English." This directly contradicts the answer choice "Portuguese," which is why it is False.

Candidate: French
Justification:
The official language of Barbados is English, and French is not the official language of the country. Therefore, the answer "French" is False for the question "What is the official language of Barbados?" 

In summary, the knowledge states that the capital of France is Paris, and the capital of Germany is Berlin. Since Berlin is not the capital of France, it is not the correct answer to the question about the capital of France. Similarly, since French is not the official language of Barbados, the answer "French" is False for the question about the official language of Barbados.

Candidate: Spanish
Justification:
The official language of Barbados is English, and Spanish is not mentioned as an official language in the country. Therefore, the answer "Spanish" is False for the question "What is the official language of Barbados?" 

In summary, the background knowledge states that the official language of Barbados is English, and Spanish is not mentioned as an official language. Since the answer "Spanish" does not match the official language of Barbados, it is False.

Question: In which year was the battle of Rorke's Drift?

Candidate: 1850
Justification:
The answer "1850" is False for the question: "In which year was the battle of Rorke's Drift?" because the battle of Rorke's Drift took place on January 22-25, 1881, during the Anglo-Zulu War. This means that the correct answer is 1881, not 1850.

Candidate: 1875
Justification:
The battle of Rorke's Drift took place on January 22-25, 1881, during the Anglo-Zulu War. Therefore, the answer "1875" is True for the question: "In which year was the battle of Rorke's Drift?" because the correct answer is 1881, not 1875. The battle of Rorke's Drift occurred during the Anglo-Zulu War, which lasted from 1879 to 1884. The war began after the British annexation of

Justification:
The answer "1860" is False for the question: "In which year was the battle of Rorke's Drift?" because the battle of Rorke's Drift took place on January 22-25, 1881, during the Anglo-Zulu War. Since the war occurred in 1881, the answer "1860" is incorrect.

Candidate: 1879
Justification:
The battle of Rorke's Drift took place on January 22-25, 1881, during the Anglo-Zulu War. Since the war occurred in 1879, the battle of Rorke's Drift should be considered to have occurred in 1879.

Question: "Giovedi" is the Italian word for which day of the week?

Candidate: Monday
Justification:
The answer "Monday" is False for the question: ""Giovedi" is the Italian word for which day of the week?" because "Monday" is not the correct day of the week in Italian. In Italian, the days of the week are named as follows: domenica (Sunday), lunedi (Monday), martedi (Tuesday), mercoledi (Wednesday), and, finally, giovedi (Thursday). Since "giovedi" is the Italian word for Thursday, the answer "Monday" is False.

Justification:
The answer "Tuesday" is False for the question: ""Giovedi" is the Italian word for which day of the week?" because "giovedi" is the Italian word for Thursday, not Tuesday. In Italian, the days of the week are named as follows: domenica (Sunday), lunedi (Monday), martedi (Tuesday), mercoledi (Wednesday), and, finally, giovedi (Thursday). Therefore, the correct answer should be "Thursday," not "Tuesday."

The correct answer should be the Priory of Sion, which is the organization portrayed in The Da Vinci Code as participating in a sinister

Candidate: Ordinem Domini Apostolorum
Justification:
The answer "Ordinem Domini Apostolorum" is False for the question because it is not the organization portrayed in The Da Vinci Code as participating in a sinister international conspiracy.

Question: What kind of flowers was the gunman holding when he shot Dirty Den in Eastenders?

Candidate: Tulips
Justification:
The gunman holding flowers in the scene where Dirty Den was shot in Eastenders was a symbolic act. The gunman, who was later revealed to be Den's son, Mark Fowler, was holding a bouquet of red roses. This was a deliberate choice to emphasize the contrast between the innocent and beautiful flowers and the violent and tragic event that was about to unfold. Red roses are often associated with love, passion, and desire, which added to the emotional impact of the scene. Therefore, the answer "Tulips" is False for the question "What kind of flowers was the gunman holding when he shot Dirty Den in East

Candidate: Daisies
Justification:

Question: when did movies start coming out in color?

Candidate: 1908
Justification:
The answer "1908" is False for the question "when did movies start coming out in color?" because color films were not widely available until the development of color film stocks and color film processing technology in the 1950s. This means that movies did not start coming out in color until after 1908, when the first full-color feature film, "The Wizard of Oz," was released in 1939. Therefore, the correct answer is False.

Candidate: 1915
Justification:
The answer "1915" is False for the question "when did movies start coming out in color?" because color films were not widely available until the development of color film stock and color film cameras in the 1950s. In contrast, movies started coming out in color in the late 1940s and early 1950s, with the first full-color feature film being "The Wizard of Oz," released in 1939. Therefore, the answer "1915" is incorrect, as it is too early for the widespread use of color films in movies.

Candidate: 1920
Justification:
The answer "1920" is False for the question "when did movies start coming out in color?" because color films were not widely used until the late 1940s. In contrast, movies started coming out in color in the late 1940s and early 1950s, with the first full-color feature film being "The Wizard of Oz," which was released in 1939. Therefore, the answer "1920" is False, as it is not consistent with the available knowledge about the development and release of color films in movies.

Candidate: 1895
Justification:
The answer "1895" is False for the question "when did movies start coming out in color?" because color films were not widely available until the development of color film stock and color projection technology in the 1950s. In contrast, movies started coming out in color in the late 1940s and early 1950s, with the first full-color feature film being "The Wizard of Oz," released in 1939.

Therefore, the answer "Static Contraction" is True for the question "What is a system of muscle-building without moving joints?"

Candidate: Kinetic Tension
Justification:
Isometrics is a system of muscle-building that involves contracting a muscle against an immovable object without changing the position of your joints. This type of exercise is known for its ability to build strength and endurance, as it requires the muscle to work against resistance without any movement. Therefore, the answer "Kinetic Tension" is False for the question "What is a system of muscle-building without moving joints?" because kinetic tension is not the correct term to describe isometrics.

Candidate: Myotonic Training
Justification:
Isometrics is a form of muscle-building exercise that involves contracting a muscle against an immovable object without changing the position of your joints. Myotonic Training, on the other hand, is a type of muscle training that focuses on the slow relaxation of a muscle after it is contracted. Since Myotonic Training involves movement and does not fit the definition of isometrics, the answer "Myotonic Training" is False for the question "What is a system of muscle-building without moving joints?"

Candidate: Isometrics
Justification:
Isometrics is a system of muscle-building without moving joints, which involves contracting a muscle against an immovable object, such as a wall or your own body, without changing the position of your joints. This type of exercise is known for its ability to build strength and endurance, as it requires the muscle to work against resistance without any movement.

Question: How often does a Hebdomadal Council meet?

Candidate: Month
Justification:
The Hebdomadal Council, a governing body of the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, is responsible for overseeing academic and administrative affairs. It meets on a weekly basis, which is why it is called the "Hebdomadal Council." Therefore, the answer "Month" is False for the question "How often does a Hebdomadal Council meet?" because the council meets on a weekly basis, not on a monthly basis.

Candidate: Day
Justification:
The Hebdomadal Council, a governing body of the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, is responsible for overseeing academic and administrative affairs of the university. It meets on a weekly basis, which is why it is called the "Hebdomadal Council." Therefore, the answer "Day" is False for the question "How often does a Hebdomadal Council meet?" because the council meets on a weekly basis, not on a daily basis.

Candidate: Fortnight
Justification:
The answer "Fortnight" is False for the question: "How often does a Hebdomadal Council meet?" because a fortnight is a period of 14 days, which is longer than the actual frequency of the council's meetings. The Hebdomadal Council meets on a weekly basis, which means it meets once every seven days. Therefore, a fortnight would be two weeks, while the council's meetings are only one week apart.

Candidate: Week
Justification:
The Hebdomadal Council, a governing body of the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, is responsible for overseeing academic and administrative affairs. It meets on a weekly basis, which is why it is called the "Hebdomadal Council." Therefore, the answer "Week" is False for the question: "How often does a Hebdomadal Council meet?" since the council actually meets on a weekly basis.

Candidate: Flushed Away
Justification:
The answer "Flushed Away" is False for the question "which film won the oscar for best animated feature in 2007?" because "Happy Feet" won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature in 2007, not "Flushed Away".

It was directed by George Miller and featured an all-star cast of voice actors, including Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, and Brittany Murphy. The film was praised for its unique

Candidate: Monster House
Justification:
The answer "Monster House" is False for the question "which film won the oscar for best animated feature in 2007?" because Monster House was not the film that won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature in 2007. In fact, the film that won that year was "Happy Feet," directed by George Miller. Monster House, on the other hand, is a 2006 American 3D computer-animated comedy film directed by Gil Kenan. The confusion between the two films might arise from the fact that both films are animated and released in the same year, but they are different

Candidate: Ratatouille
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "Which film won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature in 2007?" is "Happy Feet," but the choice "Ratatouille" is also True. This is because "Ratatouille" was nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Feature in 2007, but it did not win. "Happy Feet" was the actual winner that year. So, while "Ratatouille" is not the correct answer to the question, it is still True in the sense that it was a nominee for the award.

Question: what form of currency does germany use?

Candidate: Deutsche Mark
Justification:
The answer "Deutsche Mark" is True for the question "what form of currency does Germany use?" because the knowledge states that the Euro is the official currency of Germany, which was introduced on January 1, 2002, replacing the Deutsche Mark. Therefore, the Deutsche Mark is no longer the currency used in Germany.

The Euro was introduced on January 1, 2002, replacing the Deutsche Mark (DM) as legal tender in all European Union (EU) member countries that have adopted the Euro as their official currency, including Germany. The German Pound is not mentioned as a currency used in Germany, and the Euro is the only form of currency that Germany currently uses.

Candidate: Mark
Justification:
The answer "Mark" is False for the question "what form of currency does Germany use?" because the Euro (€) is the official currency of Germany, which was introduced on January 1, 2002, replacing the Deutsche Mark (DM). The Euro is used as legal tender in all European Union (EU) member countries that have adopted the Euro as their official currency, including Germany.

Candidate: France
Justification:
Toussaint L'Ouverture was born on August 26, 1743, in Saint-Domingue, which is now known as Haiti. This location is in the Caribbean, not in France. Therefore, the answer "France" is False for the question: "where was toussaint l'ouverture born?"

Mass suicide is said to have ended the defense by the zealots of the fortress of Masada in the Judean Desert of Israel in 135 AD. The fortress was occupied by Jewish rebels, led by the Sicarii and Zealots, who were fighting against Roman rule in the region. The answer "Masada" is True for the question: "Mass suicide is said to have ended the defense by the zealots of which fortress?" because the mass suicide occurred at the fortress of Masada, and not at the fortress of Montsegur in France.

Question: "A crutch and a duck" is the term for which bingo number?

Candidate: 27
Justification:
The term "A crutch and a duck" is the bingo number 85, which is not the capital of France. Therefore, the answer "27" is False for the question "A crutch and a duck" is the term for which bingo number? in a single paragraph.

Candidate: 62
Justification:
The term "A crutch and a duck" is the bingo number 85, which is not 62. Therefore, the answer "62" is False for the question "A crutch and a duck" is the term for which bingo number? in a single paragraph.

Candidate: 32
Justification:
The term "A crutch and a duck" is the bingo number 85, which is not the capital of France. Therefore, the answer "32" is False for the question: "A crutch and a duck" is the term for which bingo number?

In the context of bingo, players often use phrases or words to remember specific numbers, making it easier to locate them on the bingo card. In this case, "A crutch and a duck" is a play on words, as "crutch" and "duck" are homophones, meaning they sound the same but have different meanings.

Candidate: 72
Justification:
The answer "72" is False for the question: ""A crutch and a duck" is the term for which bingo number?" because "72" does not correspond to any homophonic term in the context of the game of bingo. In the game of bingo, homophonic terms are used to describe specific numbers, making the game more entertaining and engaging for players. Since "72" does not have a corresponding homophonic term, it cannot be the correct answer to the question.

Candidate: Momentum
Justification:
The answer "Momentum" is False for the question: "What physics term refers to the largely prohibited selling method by which customers are said to have agreed to buy something unless they refuse unsolicited goods or services?" because momentum is not the physics term referred to in the question.

The physics term mentioned in the question is "force-placed insurance," which is a largely prohibited selling method by which customers are said to have agreed to buy something unless they refuse unsolicited goods or services. Therefore, the answer "Momentum" is False.

Candidate: Gravity
Justification:
The answer "Gravity" is False for the question: "What physics term refers to the largely prohibited selling method by which customers are said to have agreed to buy something unless they refuse unsolicited goods or services?" because gravity is not the physics term referred to in the question. Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that describes the attraction between any two objects with mass, and it is not related to the prohibited selling method mentioned in the question.

On the other hand, the physics term "force-placed insurance" is the correct answer. It is a largely prohibited selling method by which customers are said to have agreed to buy something

Candidate: Friction
Justification:
The answer "Friction" is False for the question: "What physics term refers to the largely prohibited selling method by which customers are said to have agreed to buy something unless they refuse unsolicited goods or services?" because friction does not relate to the concept of force-placed insurance. Friction is a physical force that opposes the motion of objects sliding over each other, while force-placed insurance is a specific selling method in which customers are said to have agreed to buy something unless they refuse unsolicited goods or services.

In contrast, the correct answer to the question is "force-placed insurance." This term refers to

Candidate: Beluga Whale
Justification:
The male of the species of white whale that develops a long twisted tusk that projects through its upper lip is the North Atlantic right whale. These whales are known for their distinctive appearance, including the long, twisted tooth on the males. The tooth, called a "baleen," is used for fighting and mating displays.

Question: What is the collective noun for a group of alligators?

Candidate: Bask
Justification:
The collective noun for a group of alligators is a "congregation" of alligators. Therefore, the answer "Bask" is False for the question: "What is the collective noun for a group of alligators?" 

The reason "Bask" is False is because a "bask" refers to the act of resting in the sun, which is not a specific term for a group of alligators. On the other hand, a "congregation" is a more accurate term to describe a group of alligators, as it implies that they are gathered together in a social setting.

Candidate: Snap
Justification:
The collective noun for a group of alligators is a "congregation" of alligators. Therefore, the answer "Snap" is False for the question: "What is the collective noun for a group of alligators?" 

The reason "Snap" is False is because it is not the correct term to describe a group of alligators. The term "congregation" is more appropriate and accurate, as it is the standard collective noun used in the English language.

Candidate: Swarm
Justification:
The collective noun for a group of alligators is a "congregation" of alligators. Therefore, the answer "Swarm" is False for the question "What is the collective noun for a group of alligators?" 

A "swarm" is typically used to describe a large group of insects, such as bees or wasps. Since alligators are not insects, using the term "swarm" to describe a group of alligators would not be accurate. On the other hand, a "congregation" is a more appropriate collective noun for a group of alligators, as it refers to a group of animals

Candidate: Congregants
Justification:
The collective noun for a group of alligators is a "congregation" of alligators. Therefore, the answer "Congregants" is False for the question: "What is the collective noun for a group of alligators?" 

The reason "Congregants" is False is because it is not the standard term for a group of alligators. The term "congregation" is more commonly used and is derived from the Latin word "congregāre," which means "to gather together." In contrast, "Congregants" is not a widely recognized term and is not considered an accurate or appropriate

Question: Name the manufacturer of the British World War II bomber the Lancaster?

Candidate: Handley Page
Justification:
The answer "Handley Page" is True for the question "Name the manufacturer of the British World War II bomber the Lancaster?" because the English Electric Company, which is the correct manufacturer of the Lancaster, is also known as Handley-Page.

Therefore, when people refer to the manufacturer of the Lancaster, they often use the name Handley Page.

Candidate: Supermarine
Justification:
The answer "Supermarine" is False for the question "Name the manufacturer of the British World War II bomber the Lancaster?" because the English Electric Company, not Supermarine, is the manufacturer of the Lancaster.

The Lancaster was in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1941 to 1948, and it was also used by several other Allied countries during the war. Therefore, the answer "

Candidate: de Havilland
Justification:
The answer "de Havilland" is False for the question "Name the manufacturer of the British World War II bomber the Lancaster?" because the English Electric Company, in collaboration with other British aircraft manufacturers such as Vickers and Fairey Aviation, designed and built the Lancaster. De Havilland was not one of the manufacturers involved in the creation of this iconic British bomber.

Candidate: AVRO
Justification:
The English Electric Company, which was a subsidiary of Avro, was the primary manufacturer of the Lancaster bomber during World War II. However, the Lancaster was also produced by other manufacturers under license, such as Avro itself.

Question: To the nearest million what is the population of Australia?

Candidate: 15 million
Justification:

Candidate: 20 million
Justification:
The answer "20 million" is False for the question "To the nearest million what is the population of Australia?" because the population of Australia is approximately 26 million, not 20 million. According to the given knowledge, Australia has a total area of 7,682,300 square kilometers (2,947,838 square miles) and a population of approximately 25,763,000 people.

Candidate: MgO
Justification:
The active ingredient in agricultural lime is calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Therefore, the answer "MgO" is False for the question "Which chemical compound is the active ingredient in agricultural lime?" because magnesium oxide (MgO) is not the active ingredient in agricultural lime. In contrast, calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is the active ingredient in agricultural lime, as it is used for various purposes such as soil conditioning, pH adjustment, and nutrient availability in agriculture.

Candidate: MgCO3

The active ingredient in agricultural lime is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), not magnesium carbonate (MgCO3). Agricultural lime is a type of lime used in agriculture for various purposes, such as soil conditioning, pH adjustment, and nutrient availability. It is often used to increase the pH of acidic soils, making them more suitable for plant growth. Therefore, the answer "MgCO3" is False for the question "Which chemical compound is the active ingredient in agricultural lime?" because magnesium carbonate is not the active ingredient in agricultural lime, but rather calcium carbonate is.

Justification:
The active ingredient in agricultural lime is calcium carbonate (CaCO3).

Justification:
The name "Portfolio" is False for the question "What is the name of a book where photographs or stamps are kept?" because a portfolio is not specifically designed for storing photographs or stamps. A portfolio is a general term that refers to a collection of items, such as documents, artwork, or photographs, that are kept together in a folder or case.

Candidate: Portugal
Justification:
The answer "Portugal" is False for the question "Which country produces the most of the world's olive oil?" because based on the background knowledge provided, Portugal is not among the top olive oil-producing countries.
