It is not a drug that reduces fever and does not belong to the class of drugs known as antipyretics.

On the other hand, aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen are examples of antipyretics,

Candidate: ntipyretic
Justification:
The generic name for a drug that reduces fever is "antipyretic." The correct answer to the question "What is the generic name for a drug that reduces fever?" is "antipyretic." This is because antipyretics are a class of drugs that are specifically designed to lower a person's body temperature, particularly in cases of fever. They work by blocking the production of prostaglandins, which are responsible for increasing body temperature. Examples of antipyretics include aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. Therefore, the answer "antipyretic" is correct.

Question: The Combination Acts of 1799-1800 were repealed in 1824 – what had they banned?

Candidate: Worker Strikes
Justification:
The Combination Acts of 1799-1800 were repealed in 1824 – what had they banned?

Option: Worker Strikes

The correct answer is "Worker Strikes" because the Combination Acts of 1799-1800 were primarily aimed at regulating and controlling the activities of trade unions and political associations. These acts were designed to prevent workers from organizing collectively to improve their wages, working conditions, and other rights. The government feared that these collective efforts by workers could lead to social unrest and potentially threaten the stability of the society.



Candidate: Collective Bargaining
Justification:
The Combination Acts of 1799-1800 banned various forms of association and assembly among workers, including collective bargaining.

Question: What general name is given to a rotating star which emits a regular beat of radiation?

Candidate: Rotator
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "What general name is given to a rotating star which emits a regular beat of radiation?" is "pulsar." The term "pulsar" specifically refers to a type of rotating star, known as a neutron star, that emits regular pulses of radiation. This is in contrast to the incorrect choice "rotator," which does not accurately describe the phenomenon of a rotating star emitting regular radiation. Therefore, the answer "rotator" is incorrect.

Candidate: Stellar Oscillator
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "What general name is given to a rotating star which emits a regular beat of radiation?" is "Pulsar." Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation, primarily in the form of radio waves. These beams of radiation are directed away from the observer, and the regular pulsations are caused by the changing positions of these beams as they rotate. Pulsars were first discovered in 1967 by Anthony Hewish and his team at Cambridge University, and they have since become an important tool for studying the universe, particularly in the field of cosmology.

Candidate: Celestial Beacon
Justification:
The general name given to a rotating star that emits a regular beat of radiation is a "pulsar." Celestial Beacon is incorrect because it does not accurately describe a pulsar, which is a highly magnetized, rotating neutron star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation, primarily in the form of radio waves. The regular pulsations are caused by the changing positions of these beams as they rotate. Pulsars were first discovered in 1967 by Anthony Hewish and his team at Cambridge University, and they have since become an important tool for studying the universe, particularly in the field of cosmology. Therefore, the correct answer is "puls

Candidate: 4.8 million
Justification:
The correct answer for the question "how many customers does EDF have in the UK?" is 5.5 million. The option "4.8 million" is incorrect because it is not the most up-to-date number of customers as of 2021. However, it is still within the range of EDF's customer base in the UK.

Question: how much is a 72 oz steak at the big texan?

Candidate: $50
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "how much is a 72 oz steak at the big texan?" is not "$50." Based on the given knowledge, the price of a 72-ounce steak at The Big Texan Steak Ranch varies depending on the steak's cut and the current menu prices. However, the cost of the challenge is $72.00, and if a customer successfully completes the challenge, they get to enjoy a free 72-ounce steak dinner. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect the cost of the challenge, which is $72.00.

Candidate: $120
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "how much is a 72 oz steak at the big texan?" is $120. This is because the Big Texan Steak Ranch offers a free 72-ounce steak dinner to anyone who can eat the entire meal (steak, salad, bread, and butter) in less than an hour as part of their "Big Texan Steak Challenge." The $120 price mentioned is likely the cost of the 72-ounce steak for customers who do not participate in the challenge.

Candidate: $90
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "how much is a 72 oz steak at the big texan?" is "$90." This is because the cost of the Big Texan Steak Challenge, which includes a 72-ounce steak, is typically around $72.00. However, the option "$90" is not incorrect, as it could refer to the price of the challenge, which is the correct answer to the question.

Candidate: $72
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "how much is a 72 oz steak at the big texan?" is "$72." This is because the Big Texan Steak Ranch offers a 72-ounce steak challenge, which costs around $72.00, and the steak itself is usually a 1-inch thick cut. The other choices, such as "$50" or "$100," would be incorrect because they do not match the price of the challenge.

When the body encounters a foreign substance, such as a virus or bacteria, it produces antibodies to help

Candidate: lymph
Justification:
Lymph is incorrect for the question "where are antibodies made and by what type of lymphocyte?" because antibodies are made by B-lymphocytes, also known as B-cells, not by lymph.

Question: What is the official language of Barbados?

Candidate: Portuguese
Justification:
The official language of Barbados is English, making the option "Portuguese" incorrect for the question "What is the official language of Barbados?"

Barbados is a country located in the Caribbean region, and it is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. As a member of the Commonwealth, English is one of the official languages of Barbados. The other official language of Barbados is Bajan Creole, which is a dialect of English.

Therefore, the option "Portuguese" is incorrect for the question "What is the official language of Barbados?" because the official language of Barbados is English, not Portuguese.

Candidate: French
Justification:

Therefore, the correct answer to the question would be "English."

Candidate: Spanish
Justification:
The official language of Barbados is English, which makes the option "Spanish" incorrect for the question "What is the official language of Barbados?" In contrast to Spain, which has Spanish as its official language, Barbados is a country in the Caribbean that is a former British colony.

Question: all the motor neurons that control the skeletal muscles are?

Candidate: Voluntary
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "all the motor neurons that control the skeletal muscles are?" is "Voluntary motor neurons." This is because the knowledge states that "All the motor neurons that control the skeletal muscles are called 'voluntary motor neurons.'" These neurons are responsible for transmitting electrical signals from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles, causing them to contract and produce movement. They are part of the central nervous system and are essential for controlling voluntary movements, such as walking, talking, and grasping objects. Therefore, the option "Voluntary" is correct for the question.

Candidate: Efferent
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "all the motor neurons that control the skeletal muscles are?" is "voluntary motor neurons." Therefore, the option "Efferent" is incorrect.

Efferent neurons are a type of motor neuron, but they are not the only ones that control skeletal muscles. Voluntary motor neurons are a subset of efferent neurons, which means they are a more specific category.

Candidate: Peripheral
Justification:
The correct answer for the question "all the motor neurons that control the skeletal muscles are?" is "Voluntary motor neurons." The option "Peripheral" is incorrect for this question.

The peripheral nervous system is responsible for transmitting signals from the central nervous system to the muscles, but it does not control the skeletal muscles directly. Instead, the voluntary motor neurons, which are part of the central nervous system, are responsible for controlling voluntary movements. Therefore, the answer "Peripheral" is incorrect for this question.

Candidate: Somatic
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "all the motor neurons that control the skeletal muscles are?" is "voluntary motor neurons." This is because voluntary motor neurons are responsible for transmitting electrical signals from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles, causing them to contract and produce movement. They are part of the central nervous system and are essential for controlling voluntary movements, such as walking, talking, and grasping objects.

The option "Somatic" is not correct because somatic motor neurons are a subset of voluntary motor neurons. Somatic motor neurons control the muscles of the body's limbs and torso, while voluntary motor neurons also control

Question: What board game for two players is known as wiq in Chinese and baduk in Korean?

Candidate: Othello
Justification:
The correct answer for the question "What board game for two players is known as wiq in Chinese and baduk in Korean?" is "Go." The option "Othello" is incorrect because it refers to a different board game, which is known as "Reversi" in Chinese and "Othello" in Korean.

Candidate: Xiangqi

Question: What is the name of Long John Silver's parrot in Treasure Island?

Candidate: Polly
Justification:
The name of Long John Silver's parrot in Treasure Island is "Jolly Roger." Therefore, the option "Polly" is incorrect for the question: "What is the name of Long John Silver's parrot in Treasure Island?" 

In the novel "Treasure Island," the parrot owned by Long John Silver is named "Jolly Roger." This name is significant as it is associated with piracy and serves as a reminder of the character's background as a pirate. The parrot's name is mentioned in the novel, making "Polly" an incorrect choice for the question.

Candidate: Blackbeak
Justification:
The name of Long John Silver's parrot in Treasure Island is "Jolly Roger." Therefore, the option "Blackbeak" is incorrect for the question: "What is the name of Long John Silver's parrot in Treasure Island?" 

In the novel "Treasure Island," the parrot owned by Long John Silver is named "Jolly Roger." This name is significant as it is associated with piracy and is often used as a symbol of the pirate's code of conduct. The parrot's name is also a nod to the novel's pirate theme, as it adds to the atmosphere of the story.


Candidate: Barnaby
Justification:
The name of Long John Silver's parrot in Treasure Island is "Jolly Roger." Therefore, the option "Barnaby" is incorrect for the question: "What is the name of Long John Silver's parrot in Treasure Island?" Barnaby is not the correct answer because it does not match the name of the parrot in the story.

Candidate: Captain Flint
Justification:
The option "Captain Flint" is incorrect for the question "What is the name of Long John Silver's parrot in Treasure Island?" because the knowledge states that the name of Long John Silver's parrot in Treasure Island is "Jolly Roger."

Question: What physics term refers to the largely prohibited selling method by which customers are said to have agreed to buy something unless they refuse unsolicited goods or services?

Candidate: Momentum
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "What physics term refers to the largely prohibited selling method by which customers are said to have agreed to buy something unless they refuse unsolicited goods or services?" is "force-placed insurance." The reason for this is that "force-placed insurance" is the correct term for the selling method described in the question, which is largely prohibited and involves customers being said to have agreed to buy something unless they refuse unsolicited goods or services.

In contrast, the incorrect answer would be "momentum," as momentum is a different physics term that refers to the mass of an object multiplied by its velocity.

Candidate: Gravity
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "What physics term refers to the largely prohibited selling method by which customers are said to have agreed to buy something unless they refuse unsolicited goods or services?" is "force-placed insurance." This is because "force-placed insurance" is the correct physics term that corresponds to the description given in the question.

Gravity, on the other hand, is incorrect as it is a term related to the force of attraction between two masses, and does not refer to the prohibited selling method described in the question.

Candidate: Friction
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "What physics term refers to the largely prohibited selling method by which customers are said to have agreed to buy something unless they refuse unsolicited goods or services?" is "force-placed insurance." The reason for this is that "force-placed insurance" is the correct physics term being referred to in the question.

The incorrect answer is "Friction." This is because friction is a physical phenomenon that occurs when two surfaces rub against each other, and it is not the physics term being referred to in the question. In contrast, "force-placed insurance" is a specific type of insurance that is

Candidate: Inertia
Justification:
Inertia is incorrect for the given question. The physics term referred to in the question is "force-placed insurance," which is a largely prohibited selling method by which customers are said to have agreed to buy something unless they refuse unsolicited goods or services. Inertia, on the other hand, is a fundamental concept in classical mechanics that describes an object's resistance to change in its state of motion or rest. It is not related to the prohibited selling method mentioned in the question.

Candidate: Elis
Justification:
The Phaeacians live in the land of Scheria, which is located in the western part of the known world in the ancient Greek epic poem, The Odyssey. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "where do the Phaeacians live in the Odyssey?" is Scheria.

Question: What is the name of a book where photographs or stamps are kept?

Candidate: Scrapbook
Justification:
The term "Scrapbook" is correct for the question "What is the name of a book where photographs or stamps are kept?" because a scrapbook is a type of book specifically designed for storing and organizing memorabilia such as photographs, tickets, postcards, and other mementos. It is a common and widely recognized term for such a book, and it is used by people around the world to store and preserve their memories.

On the other hand, the term "Photobook" or "Stamps Album" would be more specific and accurate in terms of the content stored in the book. A "Photobook"

Candidate: Portfolio
Justification:
The term "portfolio" is incorrect for the question "What is the name of a book where photographs or stamps are kept?" because a portfolio is typically used to refer to a collection of documents or items, such as a collection of artwork, writing samples, or certificates. It is not specifically designed to store photographs or stamps. On the other hand, a photobook or stamps album is a book specifically designed to hold and organize photographs or stamps, making it the correct term for this type of collection.

Candidate: Album

Question: How many gifts are there in the "Twelve Days of Christmas"?"

Candidate: 378
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "How many gifts are there in the "Twelve Days of Christmas"?" is 364.

Candidate: 300
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "How many gifts are there in the "Twelve Days of Christmas"?" is 364, as mentioned in the given knowledge.

Candidate: 420
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "How many gifts are there in the "Twelve Days of Christmas"?" is 364, as mentioned in the given knowledge. The song is structured as follows:

- The first verse lists 12 gifts, and each subsequent verse adds 11 more gifts to the list, until the 12th verse, which adds 1 gift.

Candidate: 364
Justification:
The correct answer to the question "How many gifts are there in the "Twelve Days of Christmas"?" is 12.
