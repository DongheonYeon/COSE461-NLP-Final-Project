The low confidence level is due to the difference in release year and lack of setting information."}, "The wickerman": {"predicted": true, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "It is the correct answer because 'The Wicker Man' is the 1973 horror film set on the fictional island of Summerisle."}}}
{"id": "trivia_5197", "question": "What colour cat is a Russian Blue?", "candidates": {"Blue": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "The name 'Russian Blue' itself suggests a strong connection to the color blue, which is why I have a high confidence level in this answer. It's reasonable to assume that the breed's name is indicative of its coat color."}, "White": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Although Russian Blues are known for their thick coats, it's possible that they could have a white undercoat or white patches, which is why I've assigned a moderate confidence level to this answer. However, it's unlikely that the primary color of the breed is white."}, "Black": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Some cat breeds have a black coat with a blue tint, so it's conceivable that Russian Blues could have a black coat. However, the name 'Russian Blue' suggests that blue is a more prominent color, which is why my confidence level in this answer is relatively low."}, "Gray": {"predicted": true, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "The correct answer is 'Gray' because the Russian Blue is a breed of cat that is typically gray in color. This breed is well-known for its beautiful gray coat, which can range from a deep slate blue to a lighter silver shade. The other options, such as black, white, or orange, are not representative of the Russian Blue's typical appearance."}}}
{"id": "trivia_3990", "question": "What is the contraction of the German \"Geheime Staatspolizei\" used in English?\"", "candidates": {"Statepol": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "The reasoning behind this candidate is that it's a direct combination of the words \"State\" and \"Police\", which are present in the original German phrase. However, the confidence level is not very high because it doesn't account for the \"Geheime\" part, which means \"Secret\" in English."}, "Gehesta": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "This candidate is a combination of the first parts of the German words \"Geheime\" and \"Staatspolizei\". The confidence level is relatively low because it's not a very intuitive or common contraction."}, "Secpol": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "The reasoning behind this candidate is that it's a combination of the words \"Secret\" (from \"Geheime\") and \"Police\" (from \"Polizei\"). The confidence level is moderate because it's a plausible contraction, but it doesn't account for the \"Staats\" part."}, "Gestapo": {"predicted": true, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "'Gestapo' is the correct answer because it is the contraction of the German \"Geheime Staatspolizei,\" which translates to \"Secret State Police.\" This acronym, formed by combining the first letters of the original German words, is commonly used in English to refer to the feared secret police agency of Nazi Germany responsible for enforcing the regime's oppressive policies and surveillance"}}}
{"id": "trivia_2579", "question": "Which Italian liqueur is a key ingredient of the well known cocktail, Harvey Wallbanger?", "candidates": {"Limoncello": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Although Limoncello is a well-known Italian liqueur, its strong citrus flavor might overpower the other ingredients in the Harvey Wallbanger. However, its Italian origin and popularity make it a possible candidate, hence the moderate confidence level."}, "Sambuca": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Sambuca has a distinct anise flavor that might not complement the other ingredients in the Harvey Wallbanger. Its strong flavor profile reduces the confidence level, but it's still an Italian liqueur that could potentially work in the cocktail."}, "Amaro Nonino": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Amaro Nonino is a bitter Italian liqueur that might not be the best fit for the Harvey Wallbanger, which is typically a sweet and fruity cocktail. The confidence level is low due to the potential flavor clash."}, "Galliano": {"predicted": true, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "'Galliano' is the correct answer because it is the Italian liqueur that is a key ingredient in the Harvey Wallbanger cocktail."}}}
{"id": "trivia_1394", "question": "The village of Tightwad is in which US state?", "candidates": {"US-AL": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "I've assigned a low confidence level to Alabama because, while it's possible that a village with this name could exist in any state, I couldn't find any notable information or associations that would link the name \"Tightwad\" to Alabama specifically. The state has many small towns and villages, but without more context, it's difficult to make a strong connection."}, "US-AR": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Arkansas has a mix of urban and rural areas, and it's conceivable that a small village like Tightwad could be found there. However, my confidence level is still relatively low because I don't have any specific information that would suggest a strong link between the name \"Tightwad\" and Arkansas."}, "US-FL": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Florida seems like an unlikely location for a village named Tightwad, given its reputation for tourism and urban development. While it's possible that a small town or village with this name could exist in a more rural area of the state, my confidence level is low due to the lack of any obvious connections."}, "US-MO": {"predicted": true, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "The correct answer is 'US-MO' because the abbreviation 'US-MO' stands for Missouri, which is the state where Tightwad is located."}}}
{"id": "trivia_4951", "question": "Who was \"the maid of Orleans\"?\"", "candidates": {"Joan of Arc's Sister": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "The reasoning behind this low confidence level is that there is no historical record of Joan of Arc having a sister who was also known for her heroic deeds or connection to Orleans.

The confidence level is low due to the lack of direct connection."}, "Saint Catherine of Siena": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Saint Catherine of Siena was a medieval Italian saint who was known for her mystical experiences and her influence on the Catholic Church. While she was a prominent female figure in medieval Europe, there's no direct connection between her and the city of Orleans, which is why the confidence level is low."}, "Jehanne": {"predicted": true, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "Jehanne is the correct answer because she is the historical figure known as Joan of Arc, who was a young French peasant girl who led the French army to victory in several battles during the Hundred Years' War.

{"id": "trivia_5241", "question": "Which is the style of music, characterised by staccato offbeat rhythms, and owing much to the influence of mento, jazz, ska and rhythm and blues?", "candidates": {"Calypso": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "I have assigned a moderate confidence level to Calypso because it is a style of music that originated in the Caribbean, similar to the style described. Although Calypso does have a strong rhythmic component, its rhythms are not typically characterized as staccato offbeat. However, the influence of mento and other genres like jazz and rhythm and blues could be plausible, given the geographic and cultural exchange in the region."}, "Zouk": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "My confidence in Zouk is relatively low due to its distinct origins in the Caribbean, specifically among the French-speaking islands. While Zouk does incorporate elements from various genres, including jazz and rhythm and blues, its rhythmic patterns are more closely associated with a strong, consistent beat rather than staccato offbeat rhythms."}, "Soca": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Soca, a genre from the Caribbean, particularly from Trinidad and Tobago, has a higher confidence level due to its fast-paced and energetic rhythms, which could be interpreted as staccato offbeat. The influence of calypso, mento, and other genres like jazz and rhythm and blues is evident in Soca, making it a plausible candidate."}, "Reggae": {"predicted": true, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "Reggae is characterized by staccato offbeat rhythms and draws influences from mento, jazz, ska, and rhythm and blues."}}}
