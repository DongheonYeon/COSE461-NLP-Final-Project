Watermelons are not typically associated with fairy tales or magical events, making it an unlikely candidate."}, "Butterfly": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "My confidence level for this answer is relatively low because, although butterflies are often associated with transformation and magic, they are not typically linked to carriages or vehicles. The idea of a carriage turning into a butterfly seems implausible and lacks a clear connection to the Cinderella story."}, "Tree": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "I have a moderate confidence level in this answer because trees are sometimes associated with magic and fantasy in fairy tales. However, the idea of a carriage transforming into a tree seems unlikely, as it would require a significant change in form and structure."}, "Punkin": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "Answer: Cinderella's carriage turned into a pumpkin after midnight, which is why \"Punkin\" is the correct answer."}}}

The party is represented in Parliament, the Lords and the European Parliament, how is it now known?", "candidates": {"Ecology Party": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "The name change from 'People Party' to a name related to the environment is plausible, given the time period and the fact that the party is now represented in various parliamentary bodies. The term 'ecology' was gaining popularity during the 1970s, which could have influenced the name change."}, "Liberal Party": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Although the Liberal Party has undergone mergers and name changes, it's possible that the People Party merged with or was influenced by the Liberal Party. However, the lack of direct connection between the two parties reduces the confidence level."}, "Environmental Union": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "The name change to something related to the environment is likely, given the party's current representation in parliamentary bodies. 'Environmental Union' sounds like a plausible name for a party focused on environmental issues."}, "GreenParty": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "The correct answer is 'Green Party' because the question mentions that the People Party changed its name in 1975 and again in 1985.

The presence of a prominent yellow star and the dominant red color give China a high confidence level."}, "Angola": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Angola's flag features a red and black background with a yellow half-gear, a machete, and a star. Although the star is yellow, which could be mistaken for gold, the overall design and colors might not exactly match the description of a red flag with a gold star."}, "Mozambique": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Mozambique's flag features a green, yellow, black, and white background with a red triangle and a yellow five-pointed star. The presence of a yellow star and a red triangle gives Mozambique some confidence, but the multiple colors and design elements reduce the likelihood."}, "Vietnam": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "The correct answer is 'Vietnam' because its national flag is red and features a gold star on a white horizontal stripe."}}}

Additionally, commercial air travel was still in its infancy in 1915, making it unlikely that in-flight entertainment would have been a priority."}, "1935": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "This candidate answer has a moderate confidence level because the 1930s saw significant growth in the aviation industry, and in-flight amenities began to improve. However, the first in-flight movie was likely shown before this date, as the technology and infrastructure to support it would have been available earlier."}, "1925": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "The confidence level for this candidate is higher than 1915 and 1935 because the mid-1920s saw the introduction of sound in films, which would have made in-flight movies more engaging. Additionally, airlines began to focus on passenger comfort and entertainment during this period."}, "1929": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "The correct answer is '1929' because it was during this year that the first in-flight movie was shown on an internal flight in the USA."}}}
{"id": "nq_1982", "question": "where is the meridian that is opposite the prime meridian located?", "candidates": {"Countermeridian": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "I have a high confidence level in this answer because the prefix \"counter-\" implies opposition or contrast, which aligns with the concept of being opposite the Prime Meridian. This term seems like a logical and intuitive choice."}, "Opposite Meridian": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "My confidence level is relatively high for this answer because it directly states the relationship with the Prime Meridian.

However, this term might not be specific enough to geography or cartography."}, "antimeridian": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "The antimeridian is the meridian that is opposite the prime meridian. It is located at the opposite side of the globe from the prime meridian, which is the reference line used to define longitude in the International Meridian Conference in 1884."}}}
{"id": "trivia_9903", "question": "What nationality was Christian Doppler after whom the famous 'effect' is named?", "candidates": {"German": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "I have a high confidence level in this answer because Christian Doppler was born in Salzburg, which is a city located near the German border. During Doppler's time, the concept of national identity was not as rigidly defined as it is today, and the region where he was born had strong cultural and historical ties to Germany. Additionally, many notable scientists and thinkers from the region, such as Johannes Kepler, were of German descent."}, "Czech": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "My confidence level in this answer is moderate because Christian Doppler spent a significant portion of his life in Prague, which is the capital of the Czech Republic.

However, I am not aware of any direct evidence that suggests Doppler was of Czech descent."}, "Hungarian": {"predicted": true, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "I have a relatively low confidence level in this answer because, although Doppler lived and worked in Hungary for a time, there is limited information available about his connections to the Hungarian people.

It's possible that someone might refer to the book with a different color, but it's less likely."}, "Forever Shades Of Grey": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "This candidate has a lower confidence level because 'Forever' is not a word typically associated with the book title.

{"id": "trivia_4562", "question": "Which country produces the most of the world's olive oil?", "candidates": {"Italy": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Italy is renowned for its rich olive oil production, with regions like Tuscany and Puglia being major contributors. The country's climate and soil conditions are well-suited for olive cultivation, and Italian olive oil is highly prized for its quality and flavor. Given Italy's strong reputation in the olive oil industry, it's reasonable to assume that it might be the world's largest producer."}, "Greece": {"predicted": true, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Greece has a long history of olive oil production, and it's a significant contributor to the country's economy. The Greek climate and geography are ideal for olive cultivation, with many regions producing high-quality olive oil. While Greece might not be as large as some other countries, its high per-capita production and emphasis on olive oil make it a strong candidate."}, "Portugal": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Portugal is another European country with a notable olive oil production industry. Although it might not be as prominent as Italy or Greece, Portugal still produces a significant amount of olive oil, particularly in the Alentejo region.
