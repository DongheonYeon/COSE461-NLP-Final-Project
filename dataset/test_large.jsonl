It's possible that some form of passenger service began around this time, but it's unlikely to be a direct, dedicated service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia."}, "1849": {"predicted": true, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "This confidence level is higher because the late 1840s saw significant expansion and development of railroads in the United States.

While technique is crucial, the rules might not specifically focus on both feet leaving the ground at the same time."}, "Pole Vault": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "Pole vault is another jumping event where athletes use a pole to clear a bar. The technique involves a running start and then taking off, and it's plausible that the rules could include a provision about both feet leaving the ground to ensure a fair competition."}, "Run-walk": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "The correct answer is 'Long jump' because in the Long jump, disqualification occurs if both feet are off the ground at the same time."}}}
{"id": "trivia_2514", "question": "A bet of Manqué at roulette covers which group of numbers?", "candidates": {"19-36": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "I have a high confidence level in this answer because Manqué is a French term that translates to \"missing\" or \"lacking\", which could imply that it covers the higher numbers on the roulette wheel, excluding the lower ones. The numbers 19-36 seem like a plausible range for this type of bet."}, "1-12": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "My confidence level for this answer is relatively low because Manqué doesn't seem to directly relate to the concept of covering the first dozen numbers on the wheel. However, it's possible that the term could be used to describe a bet that covers a specific segment of numbers, so I'm assigning a non-zero confidence level."}, "13-24": {"predicted": false, "groundtruth": false, "justification": "I have a moderate confidence level in this answer because it covers a middle range of numbers on the wheel. The term Manqué could potentially be used to describe a bet that covers a transitional or intermediate range of numbers, which might include the numbers 13-24."}, "1–18": {"predicted": true, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "Correct answer: Manqué at roulette covers the group of numbers 1–18.\n\nJustification: Manqué is a type of bet in roulette where a player bets that the winning number will be between 1 and 18. Since there are 18 numbers between 1 and 18 (inclusive), this bet covers this specific group of numbers."}}}

Taiwan does have nuclear power plants, but none are known by this name."}, "Japan": {"predicted": true, "groundtruth": true, "justification": "The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station is located in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. The reason why 'Japan' is the correct answer is because it is the country where the nuclear power station is situated."}}}
